+ **Instant PDF Generation:** Generate your resume PDF instantly without any delays. The tool ensures a quick turnaround time, allowing users to access their resumes promptly.

+ **Privacy Assurance:** We prioritize user privacy and security. Rest assured that none of the data provided during the resume-building process is saved or stored anywhere.

## About the Source Code

The JavaScript code (`script.js`) in this repository powers the Resume Builder, allowing users to input their personal and professional information and generate a professional resume in PDF format. Below is an overview of the key functionalities implemented in the source code:

+ **Input Retrieval**: The script retrieves user input from the HTML form, including personal details, work experience, education, skills, and profile photo.

+ **PDF Initialization and Styling**: It initializes a new instance of jsPDF, a JavaScript library for generating PDF documents, and sets up the styling for the PDF layout, including fonts, line widths, and colors.

+ **Content Generation**: The script dynamically generates the content of the PDF document based on the user input. It populates sections such as contact information, skills, professional summary, work experience, and education with the values entered by the user.

+ **Image Handling**: If the user uploads a profile photo, the script converts the image data to a base64-encoded string and adds it to the PDF document using the `addImage` method.

+ **PDF Saving**: Finally, the script saves the generated PDF document with the filename "MyResume.pdf", allowing users to download and save their resumes locally.

The codebase is well-organized and follows best practices to ensure readability, maintainability, and scalability. Contributions and feedback are welcome to further enhance the functionality and usability of the Resume Builder.


## Privacy and Security
+ **No Data Storage:** I do not store any user data provided during the resume-building process. Your information is used solely for the purpose of generating your resume PDF.
